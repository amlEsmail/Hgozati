              <p>Privacy is the no. 1 concern of Internet users.
                We understand and respect that. We never want to lose your trust over privacy concerns.
                Here’s what you should know about our commitment to your privacy:
                Hogozati FZE will not disclose your personal information to third-party companies without your consent
                with the exception to the regularly required details.
                We may share aggregate data about our users with business partners, advertisers or sponsors. For
                example, we will say the Hogozati.com audience is x percent females and y percent males. But our
                motivation in doing so is to deliver better content and services to you.
                We use a combination of self-served and third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit
                our web site. Our third-party advertising company also separately places or recognizes a cookie file on
                your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this site. These companies may use
                information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to
                this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

                    If you sign up for our newsletters and/or services and later change your mind, an easy unsubscribe
                    option will always be detailed in our email newsletter and posted on our web site.
                    To receive an email from us, you will need to give us your first and last name and email address. We
                    will not require any other information. There are cases where we may ask you for personal
                    information, such as your birth date. We need to collect this information for fulfilling leads,
                    tracking/verifying compliance with our policies and/or for editorial and feedback purposes.
                    In case you change your mind, or some personal information may change (such as your email address),
                    we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You
                    can do this by contacting our support centre.

                    Why we collect IP addresses.
                    An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the
                    Web. Web servers — the big computers that “serve up” Web pages — automatically identify your
                    computer by its IP address.

                    We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information
                    to our advertisers and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from our sites, our
                    servers log the guests’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally
                    identifiable, which means that a user’s session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to
                    us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce
                    compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or
                    others.

                    We occasionally use cookies which are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an
                    individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. They make Web-surfing easier by saving your
                    preferences while you’re at a web site.

                    We link to other Internet sites.
                    Users should be aware that when you are on our sites, you could be directed to other sites that are
                    beyond our control. There are links to other sites from our website pages that take you outside our
                    service. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal
                    information.

                    Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online — for example, via
                    message boards or chat — that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know. While
                    we strive to protect our users’ personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security
                    of any information you disclose on-line. You do so at your own risk.
                    Our policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and
                    therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or
                    governmental regulation.

                      The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

                  <p>
                      As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we can’t ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services. You do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
